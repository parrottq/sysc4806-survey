SYSC 4806 Fall 2023 Team Project: Mini-SurveyMonkey web app

![Status Badge](https://github.com/parrottq/sysc4806-survey/actions/workflows/main_mini-survey.yml/badge.svg)

## Description:

The goal of this team project is to reproduce a simplified version of the popular survey creation tool, SurveyMonkey. 


## Usage:

The application allows surveyors to create a survey with a list of questions. These questions can be open-ended (text), or asking to choose among many options.

Users can then fill out the survey that is a form generated based on the type of questions in the survey. Once the surveyor closes the survey, a survey result is generated, compiling the answers: for open-ended questions, the answers are just listed as-is, for number questions a histogram of the answers is generated, for choice questions a pie chart is generated.
